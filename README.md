# Smart Attendance
Smart attendance system enables the end-user to make his/her weekly attendance updations. With the help of his phone, all he needs to do is take a picture and upload it on the website and he will get the results of the weekly attendance in an excel sheet.

The user will also be able to make his own personal account on which all of his data will be maintained and the timeline of upload and download will be kept for further use.
